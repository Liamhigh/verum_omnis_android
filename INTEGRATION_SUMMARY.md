# Integration Summary — DSS-12 Android Zip → 1verum-main

**Date:** 2026-07-14  
**Source:** `C:\Users\Gary\Downloads\holy grail\1verum-dss-12-android.zip`  
**Approach:** Surgical integration (Option A) — preserved the existing app shell, identity/OJRS/security/trust/work subsystems, and BrainCouncil governance while dropping in the zip's best packages.

## What was integrated

### Phase 1 — Hybrid Contradiction Engine
- Added `app/src/main/java/com/verumomnis/forensic/engine/contradiction/` (9 Kotlin files):
  - `VerumContradictionEngine.kt` — orchestrator
  - `ContradictionDetectors.kt` — 16 detectors (10 base + 6 DIGSIM)
  - `SemanticAnalyzer.kt` — deterministic 100-dim character-hash embeddings + negation detection
  - `ConfidenceCalibrator.kt` — per-detector false-positive calibration
  - `ClaimExtractor.kt`, `TripleVerifier.kt`, `CaseConfigurations.kt`, `EngineModels.kt`, `EngineEnums.kt`
- Added adapter `ContradictionToForensicAdapter.kt` mapping new engine output to canonical `model/Models.kt`.
- Modified `engine/NineBrainEngine.kt` to use the new engine as B1's primary path. Legacy `engine/v531c/` is kept but deprecated.
- Added test `ContradictionEngineTest.kt`.

### Phase 2 — Website-Compatible Sealing
- Added `app/src/main/java/com/verumomnis/forensic/seal/` (7 Kotlin files):
  - `DocumentSealer.kt` — PDFBox-Android VO-DSS-1.2 sealer with watermark, QR, footer, optional AES-256 password, cover page, per-page error recovery
  - `SealMetadata.kt` / `SealMetadataCodec` — emits `https://verumglobal.foundation/verify.html?h=<sha512_prefix>&m=<base64_metadata>`
  - `SealChain.kt`, `SealVerifier.kt`, `SealHasher.kt`
  - `OpenTimestampsClient.kt` — stubbed to avoid duplicating the canonical `blockchain/OpenTimestampsService.kt`
- Added website-matched assets: `vo_badge.png`, `vo_banner.png`, `vo_globe.png`.
- Updated `pdf/SealedPdfGenerator.kt` so generated report cover QR uses the website verify URL format.
- Updated `engine/ReportGenerator.kt` to populate GPS metadata for the QR payload.
- Added "Seal Document (website format)" action in `ui/VerumApp.kt` and `ui/VerumViewModel.kt`.
- Added test `seal/SealStandardTest.kt`.

### Phase 3 — G3 Hybrid Report Pipeline
- Copied spec/docs from zip:
  - `FINDINGS_JSON_SCHEMA.json`
  - `findings_json_emitter.py`
  - `G3_HYBRID_REPORT_PIPELINE.md`
  - `G3_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`
  - `examples/standardbank_findings_v531c.json`
- Added `engine/FindingsJsonEmitter.kt` that serialises `ForensicFindings` to the findings JSON contract with `ENGINE-VERIFIED` status and a `raiseG3Candidate()` helper for `G3-RAISED CANDIDATE - PENDING VERIFICATION` records.
- Modified `engine/ForensicService.kt` to write a `findings_<case>_<timestamp>.json` artefact into the vault after each scan.
- Modified `engine/ReportWriter.kt` so `DeterministicReportWriter` appends a labelled G3 candidate tier and `Gemma3ReportWriter` includes the candidate-tier rule in its prompt.
- Added test `FindingsJsonEmitterTest.kt`.

### Phase 4 — Documentation
- Updated `AGENTS.md` module layout and added DSS-12 integration notes.
- Updated `BUILD_STATUS.md` to reflect v5.3.1c-dss12-integrated status and revised feature rows.

## What was deliberately NOT merged
- The zip's `MainActivity.kt`, `VerumApp.kt`, `VerumViewModel.kt`, `ForensicService.kt`, `NineBrainEngine.kt` wholesale — the existing versions preserve extra subsystems (`identity/`, `ojrs/`, `security/`, `trust/`, `work/`).
- The zip's `pdf/SealedPdfGenerator.kt` / `SealedPageRenderer.kt` — the existing native `PdfDocument` renderer is more deeply integrated with exhibits and UI; only the QR URL format was ported.
- The zip's `blockchain/OpenTimestampsClient.kt` — kept the existing `OpenTimestampsService.kt` as canonical and stubbed the duplicate.

## Test result
```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 5m 42s
27 actionable tasks: 3 executed, 24 up-to-date
```
Full `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` passes.

## Next steps
- Consider promoting the most useful `engine/v531c/` detectors into `engine/contradiction/` and removing the deprecated package once the new engine is fully validated.
- The Gemma 3 hybrid pipeline is now wired end-to-end behind `llm/Gemma3Runtime`:
  `ForensicService.scan` runs `G3ReviewPass` (second-pass contradiction catching into
  `G3CandidateRegistry`, merged into the findings JSON with tier counts),
  `Gemma3ReportWriter` performs real inference for the narrative appendix when a
  runtime is installed, and promoted candidates become local engine rules via
  `LocalRuleStore` (served through the same additive path as signed downloaded rules).
  Only the native llama.cpp build (`libverum_llama.so`) and a provisioned
  `files/models/gemma3-*.gguf` are still required to activate it (KNOWN_BUGS BUG-002);
  without them every stage falls back to the deterministic pipeline.
