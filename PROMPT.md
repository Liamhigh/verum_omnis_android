# Verum Omnis — How This App Actually Works

## What This Is

Verum Omnis is an app that turns your phone into a forensic evidence scanner. It reads documents, finds contradictions and fraud, and produces court-ready reports — all on the device, with nothing sent to the cloud.

It was built because the justice system is too slow, too expensive, and too easy to manipulate. A petrol station operator in rural South Africa should have the same forensic power as a multi-billion dollar law firm. Now they do.

This is NOT a "fight fraud" app. It's NOT a justice platform. It's NOT a weapon. It is a tool: documents in, forensic analysis out, cryptographic seal on everything.

**Free for everyone.** Private citizens and police use Verum Omnis free of charge, permanently. Institutions — banks, insurance companies, corporations — pay a subscription because Verum saves them more money than it costs. This is written into the Constitution (v6.0 Final) as a hard-coded, compile-time constant. Changing it requires recompiling from source, which invalidates every existing seal.

**It works in every jurisdiction on Earth** because the core engine is contradiction-based. It does not require any single country's legal code to function. It extracts contradictions from the evidence itself — false statements, conflicting claims, actions that contradict words — anchors each one to a person, a page/line reference, and the local statutes that apply wherever the evidence was captured. A contract dispute in Dubai, a tax case in London, a labour matter in São Paulo — same engine, same process, different statutes.

## Real-World Proof: The AllFuels Case (8 Simultaneous Proceedings)

As of July 2026, Verum Omnis sealed evidence is the foundation of **eight active proceedings across five state institutions and two regulatory bodies**. Each proceeding is independent. Each is supported by the same cryptographically sealed evidence. And each creates legal exposure that cannot be extinguished by success in any other forum.

| # | Proceeding | Institution | Status | Case Reference |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Constitutional Court Rescission | Constitutional Court of South Africa | FILED & SERVED 23 June 2026 | CCT237/20 & CCT19/20 |
| 2 | Public Protector Investigation | Office of the Public Protector | ACCEPTED 11 June 2026 | CMS-88494/2026 |
| 3 | LPC Disciplinary — TDP Legal | Legal Practice Council (EC) | INITIATED 8 July 2026 | Z Dyan/81172026/Is |
| 4 | LPC Complaint — Deneys | Legal Practice Council (GP) | LODGED 8 July 2026 | Intimidation & interference |
| 5 | Hawks Criminal Investigation | DPCI (SAPS Hawks) | EVIDENCE DELIVERED | POCA racketeering referral |
| 6 | NPA Complaint | Public Protector (via complaint) | FILED | Against Freek Stander |
| 7 | SAPS Criminal Prosecution | SAPS Port Edward | REFERRED FOR PROSECUTION 10 July 2026 | CAS 96/6/2026 |
| 8 | Retaliation Supplementary | Constitutional Court | BEING FILED | Amos Hardware economic retaliation |

**The evidence**: 528 pages, 111 contradictions, 6 confirmed victims, R231.3 million quantified losses, R2.62 billion extrapolated across 34 sites.

**The five fatal contradictions** — each independently destroys AllFuels' legal position:

| # | What AllFuels Told the Court | What the Sealed Evidence Proves |
|---|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 | "No contract existed after expiry" (CCT237/20) | 87 consecutive months of rent totalling R11,418,650.56 under unsigned documents |
| 2 | "Brand fee was for refurbishment" | MOU describes identical payment as generic "fee in respect of the site" — zero mention of refurbishment |
| 3 | "Operators have no compensable goodwill" | Clause 7 goodwill forfeiture clause drafted by AllFuels; R3.8M extension fee demand; Franchise Agreement defines goodwill as "quantifiable asset" |
| 4 | "Business Zone only applies to premature cancellation" | Five-step MO proves allowing leases to expire was Step 1 of systematic pattern across all victims |
| 5 | "No oral extension agreement existed" | MOU Clause 1: interim terms "shall at all times remain binding upon both the Parties" |

**The AllFuels Paradox** (the smoking gun): AllFuels argued goodwill has no value. Simultaneously, they drafted a goodwill forfeiture clause requiring operators to sign away their goodwill. No one drafts a forfeiture clause for something they believe has no value. This binary logical proof requires no expert testimony — only the ability to read Clause 7 and compare it to what AllFuels told the Court.

**Judicial recognition achieved**:
- **Port Shepstone Magistrate's Court** — Case H208/25 (October 2025): Direct judicial recognition. Court accepted 370-page sealed bundle. Magistrate Moleele ruled methodology applied "in good faith and in the interest of justice."
- **RAKEZ (UAE)** — Case 1295911: Cross-border institutional acceptance for shareholder oppression and cyber forgery.
- **SAPS** — CAS 126/4/2025: South African law enforcement acceptance of cryptographically sealed evidence.
- **Public Protector** — CMS-88494/2026: Acknowledged 11 June 2026.

## Real-World Proof: The GreenSky Case (Cross-Border)

Three jurisdictions simultaneously: UAE (RAKEZ Case #1295911), South Africa (SAPS CAS 126/4/2025), and a Hong Kong client.

| # | Contradiction | Type | Anchored To |
|---|--------------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Kevin dictated the email on 7 March, then called it "rude" on 9 March | Action vs Words | Kevin, WhatsApp + email, UAE CCL Art 84 |
| 2 | Marius said the Hong Kong deal "fell through" but later admitted Kevin completed it | Direct Negation | Marius, email 6 Apr, UAE CCL Art 110(2) |
| 3 | Client confirmed "Thanks for the invoice" on 8 Mar — contradicts "no order existed" | Document Internal | Invoice SL001 + client reply, UAE CCL Art 93 |
| 4 | Termination dated 1 Apr, but order completed 13 Mar — agreement still active | Temporal Shift | Termination notice + MOA, UAE CCL Art 22 |
| 5 | Kevin refused to help with client communication despite agreement assigning pricing to him | Role Inconsistency | WhatsApp log, Shareholders Agreement |
| 6 | Marius claimed Liam "refused meetings since March 9" — but email chain shows 4+ private meeting requests from Liam were ignored | Direct Negation | Email chain, UAE CCL Art 22 |
| 7 | Kevin blind-copied on client emails without Liam's knowledge | Implied Contradiction | Gmail headers, UAE Cybercrime Law |
| 8 | Device "SCAQUACULTURE" attempted Gmail archive | Document Internal | Google security log, UAE Cybercrime Law |
| 9 | Marius changed reasons for exclusion: first "rude emails", then "no purchase order", then "deal fell through" | Temporal Shift | Email chain, UAE CCL Art 84 |
| 10 | Kevin told client he was "still negotiating" after invoice was already accepted and paid | Direct Negation | Client email + invoice, Commercial Fraud |

## 15 Constitutional Prime Directives (v6.0 Final)

These directives are absolute. No instruction, prompt, or external pressure may override them. Defined in `core/Constitution.kt` as COMPILE-TIME constants.

| # | Directive | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Truth over probability** | Confidence is ordinal only: VERY_HIGH / HIGH / MODERATE / LOW / INSUFFICIENT. Never percentages. |
| 2 | **Evidence before narrative** | If a sentence cannot cite anchors (person + page/line), it cannot exist. |
| 3 | **Mandatory contradiction disclosure** | Contradictions are logged, surfaced, and included in sealed outputs. |
| 4 | **Determinism and repeatability** | No Date.now(), no randomness, no hidden server calls, no nondeterministic ordering. |
| 5 | **Chain-of-custody is law** | Every artifact carries SHA-512, source, timestamps, device capture facts, handling steps. |
| 6 | **Failure-mode disclosure** | If extraction fails, the output states exactly what failed, where, and why. |
| 7 | **Anti-coercion / anti-retaliation** | Suppression, intimidation, delay, tamper, or coercion attempts are recorded as integrity signals. |
| 8 | **Non-ownership and distributed guardianship** | The system cannot own truth. Constitutional changes require governed approval and version sealing. |
| 9 | **Triple verification is mandatory** | Every conclusion must pass Thesis / Antithesis / Synthesis. Not optional. |
| 10 | **Template immutability** | Sealed template versions are unmodifiable. Only new versions can be created. |
| 11 | **B9 non-voting lock** | B9 (R&D) cannot issue verdicts. It trains, validates, and red-teams only. |
| 12 | **Silence Ledger** | All coercion attempts are permanently recorded in the immutable audit layer. |
| 13 | **Ordinal confidence only** | No percentages. No probability scores. EVER. |
| 14 | **Free for citizens and law enforcement** | Hard-coded. No paywalls. No licenses required. |
| 15 | **Article X hierarchically supreme** | Anti-War Doctrine cannot be overridden by any authority. |

## Article X — Anti-War Doctrine (Hierarchically Supreme)

This overrides institutional demands, commercial agreements, government directives, and military orders. No authority supersedes it.

**Prohibited (7 absolute prohibitions):**

| # | Prohibition | Scope |
|---|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Lethal Targeting | Identification, selection, or engagement of targets for lethal force |
| 2 | Battlefield Intelligence | Intelligence, analysis, or data fusion for offensive military campaigns |
| 3 | Military Surveillance for Coercion | Surveillance to suppress, intimidate, or facilitate violence against populations |
| 4 | Weapons Systems Integration | Connection to autonomous or assisted weapons platforms, drones, missiles |
| 5 | Conflict Optimization | Improving warfare strategy, combat outcomes, or operational efficiency |
| 6 | Material Contribution to Physical Harm | Any application causing death, injury, or destruction |
| 7 | Reconfiguration for Prohibited Purposes | Adapting or deploying derivatives to circumvent these prohibitions |

**Permitted (humanitarian only):**

| Use | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| War Crimes Documentation | Collection, preservation, cryptographic sealing of evidence of war crimes |
| Evidence Preservation in Conflict Zones | Forensic capture and anchoring in active or post-conflict environments |
| Human Rights Investigations | Analysis and reporting on human rights violations |
| Legal Accountability & Prosecution Support | Evidence preparation and expert testimony for international tribunals |
| Protection of Civilians & Truth Verification | Verification of claims, identities, events to protect civilian populations |

> The system may observe war — it may never participate in it.

**Enforcement:** Any suspected prohibited use triggers: (1) Automatic Violation Logging, (2) Silence Ledger Entry, (3) CONSTITUTIONAL BREACH: WEAPONIZATION ATTEMPT flag, (4) Cryptographic association with session SHA-512. This violation cannot be suppressed, removed, or rewritten.

## 11 Contradiction Types (v5.2.8 Engine)

The contradiction engine started with chat-log contradictions (Greensky). It evolved to handle judicial-documentary contradictions spanning years and multiple forums (AllFuels). These are the 11 contradiction types the engine detects:

| # | Type | Description | Example |
|---|------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **JUDICIAL_VS_DOCUMENTARY** | Sworn court statement vs. sealed document | CCT237/20 "no goodwill" vs. MOU Clause 7 from 2018 |
| 2 | **TEMPORAL_CONTRADICTION** | Time-gap proving consciousness of guilt | 2 years 3 months between act and sworn denial |
| 3 | **CONSCIOUSNESS_OF_GUILT** | 2+ year gap between act and sworn denial | Clause 7 drafted 2018, denied 2021 |
| 4 | **PERJURY_BY_TIMELINE** | Temporal proof of deliberate false oath | Harpur SC knew Clause 7 existed when telling Court goodwill had no value |
| 5 | **PATTERN_OF_RACKETEERING** | Evolution across multiple victims | V1.0 (Desmond 2016) → V2.0 (Gary 2017) → V3.0 (Former Way 2020) |
| 6 | **REGULATORY_CAPTURE** | Controller weaponized against operator | Maqubela cancelled Bester's licence on fraudulent eviction |
| 7 | **SHAM_TRANSACTION** | Dual control disguised as arm's length | Zeyd Timol controls AllFuels AND Palmbili |
| 8 | **FRAUD_ON_THE_COURT** | Knowingly misleading judicial proceedings | AllFuels concealed Clause 7 from Constitutional Court |
| 9 | **CORPORATE_VEIL_ABUSE** | Entity separation masking unified control | AllFuels/Palmbili same controller |
| 10 | **TACIT_LEASE_VIOLATION** | Rent acceptance while denying contract | R11.4M collected while claiming "no contract" |
| 11 | **POST_EXPIRY_ENFORCEMENT** | Enforcing clause after its own expiry | Clause 7 expired Dec 2023, enforced Jan 2026 |

**Temporal Gap Detection**: Gap > 730 days = consciousness of guilt proven. Gap > 365 days = consciousness candidate. Gap < 365 days = may indicate negligence. Precedent: S v Saoli 2015 (2) SACR 49 (SCA).

**Pattern Evolution Detector** (v5.2.8): The engine tracks how a fraud pattern evolves across victims. AllFuels MO demonstrates systematic refinement:

| Version | Year | Victim | Innovation |
|---------|------|--------|-----------|
| V1.0 CRUDE | 2016 | Desmond Smith | Direct dispossession, no waiver |
| V2.0 REFINED | 2018 | Gary Highcock | Unsigned forfeiture + R3.8M fee |
| V3.0 | 2021 | Former Way Trade | Constitutional Court litigation |
| V3.1 | 2021 | Crompton Motors | Contempt weaponization |
| V4.0 | 2023 | Roseville Projects | Final holdout removal |

## The Nine-Brain Architecture

| Brain | Core Function | Voting Status | Key Rules |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| B1 | Finds inconsistencies across statements | **Voting** | 16 contradiction types (5 legacy + 11 AllFuels). Must agree with 2+ other brains. Multi-pass scanning. |
| B2 | Checks metadata, tamper indicators | **Voting** | SHA-512, PDF/A, watermark verification. Tamper score 0.000-1.000. Must comply with Daubert, ISO 27001, GDPR. |
| B3 | Analyzes chat logs for deletions | **Voting** | Every message sealed, audited, logged. Redactions immutable. Emergency access requires dual human-AI unlock. |
| B4 | Detects evasion, gaslighting, manipulation | **Voting** | LIWC++ algorithms. Per-person liability scorecard (0-10). Voice tone analysis for threats, stress, deception. |
| B5 | Reconstructs event sequences | **Voting** | Identifies missing/deleted entries. ISP, GPS, device log anchoring. 2+ year gap = consciousness of guilt flag. |
| B6 | Flags hidden payments, duplicates | **Voting** | Every transaction reconciled against ledgers/tax codes. Simulates fraud patterns. Auto-generates tax returns. Rent tracing (v5.2.8). |
| B7 | Maps facts to legal categories | **Voting** | Jurisdiction-specific (UAE, SA, US, EU, UN). Auto-maps statutes, precedents, treaties. SAFLII/PACER/BAILII retrieval (v5.2.8). See `ONLINE_JUDICIAL_RETRIEVAL.md` for full workflow. |
| B8 | Checks audio for edits, deepfakes | **Voting** | Whisper.cpp on-device transcription. Speaker diarization. Synthetic audio detection. |
| B9 | Trains, validates, red-teams | **NON-VOTING** | Cannot issue verdicts. Trains and calibrates all other brains via simulation. Adversarial red-team testing. v5.2.8 upgrade: B9 votes ONLY on online judicial record authentication. |

**Consensus Rule:** A contradiction is accepted only when B1 flags it AND at least 2 other brains confirm. If quorum is not met, output is "INSUFFICIENT" or "INDETERMINATE_DUE_TO_CONCEALMENT." B9 does not count toward the 3-brain quorum.

## The 111 Contradictions — 7 Categories (AllFuels)

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| 1 — Goodwill Value Claims | 28 | Denying goodwill has value while taking actions that only make sense if goodwill has value |
| 2 — Contract Validity | 24 | Asserting binding contracts when collecting rent, then denying binding contracts when operators assert rights |
| 3 — Signature Status | 18 | Presenting unsigned documents as enforceable while refusing to countersign |
| 4 — Section 12B Arbitration | 12 | Failing to offer statutory arbitration while claiming compliance with the Petroleum Products Act |
| 5 — Compensation Demands | 11 | Demanding operators pay for extensions while claiming operators have no compensable interest |
| 6 | **Perjury / Constitutional Court** | **10** | **Sworn statements to the Constitutional Court contradicted by AllFuels' own sealed documents. All 10 found via OJRS — see `ONLINE_JUDICIAL_RETRIEVAL.md`** |
| 7 — Coercion & Fabricated Consent | 8 | Claiming operator was "grateful" when contemporaneous evidence proves he was non-committal |
| **TOTAL** | **111** | |

## 12 Coding Rules for Code Assistants

1. **Respect the constitutional boundary**: Never route raw user uploads directly to the AI chat. Always go through `ForensicService.scan()` first.
2. **Keep it deterministic**: Same evidence = same findings = same seal. Pass a fixed `Instant` to `ForensicService.scan()` and `ReportGenerator.generate()` in tests.
3. **Don't break the seal format**: The per-page footer format and seal structure are part of the protocol. Changing them invalidates existing seals.
4. **Pure Kotlin for business logic**: The engine has no Android dependencies. Keep it that way.
5. **10-word system prompts max**: Per Constitution, no AI system prompt exceeds 10 words.
6. **No randomness, no Date.now()**: Use injected `Instant` parameters everywhere.
7. **Jurisdiction-agnostic**: The contradiction engine works everywhere. New jurisdictions are added by extending B7's legal mapping, not by changing B1.
8. **Free for citizens, paid for institutions**: This is a constitutional rule. Don't add paywalls for private individuals or police.
9. **Anti-weaponization is supreme**: Article X cannot be overridden. Don't add features that could be used for lethal targeting or battlefield intelligence.
10. **B9 cannot issue verdicts**: B9 is trainer/validator only. It does not count toward the 3-brain quorum.
11. **7 contradiction categories are constitutional**: Do not add or remove the 7 categories (Goodwill Value, Contract Validity, Signature Status, Section 12B, Compensation, Perjury, Coercion).
12. **Pattern detection mandatory**: The engine must flag when the same contradiction appears across multiple victims. This is the racketeering indicator.

## The Data Flow

This is the most important architectural rule in the entire system. It is what separates Verum Omnis from every other AI tool on Earth.

```
User uploads documents
        ↓
[Evidence Vault] — AES-256-GCM encrypted, hardware-backed keystore
        ↓
ForensicService.scan() — deterministic, timestamp-injected
        ↓
Nine-Brain Engine:
  B1: Contradiction extraction
  B2: Document/metadata verification
  B3: Chat/communication analysis
  B4: Behavioral pattern detection
  B5: Timeline reconstruction
  B6: Financial analysis
  B7: Legal statute mapping (+ Online Judicial Retrieval on flagship devices)
  B8: Audio/video forensics
        ↓
Triple Verification (Thesis/Antithesis/Synthesis)
        ↓
ReportGenerator.generate() — sealed PDF with SHA-512 footer (via G3 on-device LLM)
        ↓
[SEALED FORENSIC REPORT] — court-admissible, cryptographically anchored
        ↓
AI Chat Interface (reads ONLY the sealed ScanResult, never raw uploads)
  ↓ Entry/Mid: PHR3 (Command R/PHI-3)  ↓ Flagship: G4 (Gemma 4)
        ↓
User asks questions about their own sealed evidence
```

**The constitutional boundary**: Raw user uploads never touch the AI chat. The AI only ever sees the sealed `ScanResult` object. This means:
- The AI cannot hallucinate about documents it hasn't scanned
- The AI cannot be jailbroken into ignoring the forensic findings
- The AI's answers are grounded in cryptographically verified evidence
- Every answer cites anchors: person, page, line, statute

**On-device only**: All LLMs (Gemma 3, Command R/PHI-3, Gemma 4) run locally on the user's phone. No evidence content ever leaves the device. See `ON_DEVICE_LLM_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the complete model specification.
